        <p class="lead">
            In this article, we are considering that you have already setup all the tools mentioned in the article Setup
            React Development Environment
        </p>
        <p>Now, when you download <a
                href="https://themeforest.net/item/wieldy-react-redux-admin-template/22277962?s_rank=1">Wieldy - React
            Redux Admin Template based on Ant Framework</a> from themeforest.net. You will receive a zip file with a
            name like <span class="f-path small">Wieldy-{x.x}</span> where {x.x} represents to the latest version
            number.
        </p>
        <p>Extracting this file will give you a folder which will further contain 4 sub-folders. This folder represents to the React version of Wieldy .</p>

        <p><span class="f-path small">source/</span>. You can use this folder to setup your demo project.</p>
    
        <p><span class="f-path small">build/</span>. Build folder contains the built distribution (production) version,
            which is for demo purpose only</p>

        <h4>To Run the Demo</h4>

        <div class="callout callout-warning"><p>Note: <em>build/ </em>folder contains the built distribution
            (production) version, which is for demo purpose only</p></div>
        <section>
            <div class="callout callout-info"><p>You can build a local server using WAMP or XAMP (if you
                use PHP). Also it's pretty easy to build one with Python or Ruby (if you prefer either of them). Here,
                in our case, we are going to build a local server in NodeJS</p></div>
            <p><strong>Preparation:</strong></p>
            <P>You'll need to install <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js >=v8.5.0 (Recommended Version)</a> (NPM comes
                along with
                it) and serve (a NPM package)</P>
            <p>For environments using Node, the easiest way to handle this would be to install
                <strong>serve</strong> and let it handle the rest:</p>
            <pre>
$ npm install -g serve
$ serve -s build</pre>
            <p>The last command shown above will serve your static site on the port 5000. Like many of serve’s
                internal settings, the port can be adjusted using the <strong>-p</strong> or <strong>--port</strong>
                flags.</p>
            <p>It'll return something like this: </p>
            <pre>

   ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │                                                  │
   │   Serving!                                       │
   │                                                  │
   │   - Local:            http://localhost:5000      │
   │   - On Your Network:  http://192.168.9.63:5000   │
   │                                                  │
   │   Copied local address to clipboard!             │
   │                                                  │
   └──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                </pre>

            <p>Then you can view the template on <code>http://localhost:5000</code> in your browser</p>
        </section>


        <h4>To setup Wieldy react demo</h4>
        <p>you can copy this source/ folder to the location where you want to setup the demo.</p>
        <p>For example, to your desktop.</p>
        <p>Now, after copying the folder, you can rename this with the project name you want to give it to. Let’s say
            wieldy-demo</p>
        <p>Then open your command line tool. This is powershell in windows and terminal on mac/linux.</p>
        <p>In this command line tool, let’s go inside the wieldy-demo folder with command CD</p>
        <p>Once you are there, all you need to do is, run the command <span class="f-path small command">$ yarn</span>.
            This will import all the dependencies Wieldy react demo uses.</p>
        <p>Okay, so now we have all the dependency libraries imported successfully. Its the time to start demo in
            browser and all you need to do for that is run the command <span
                    class="f-path small command">$ yarn start</span>.</p>
        <p>This will shortly run the demo in your default browser automatically.</p>
        <p>So, that is all you have to do to import source code of the Wieldy react demo and run it locally. If you
            want to build a compiled version of demo. You need to run the command <span class="f-path small command">$ yarn build</span>
            and this will build a compiled version of demo for you.</p>
