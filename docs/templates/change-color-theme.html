        <p>This article is dedicated to learn how to change the color theme in the starter template.</p>
        <p>So, first thing first, we are talking about the style. Right?</p>
        <p>This means the first folder we need to access is <span class="f-path">src/styles/</span></p>
        <p>All of the style related work is placed here in this folder.</p>
        <p>Then, inside this <span class="f-path">styles/</span> folder, there is a file <span class="f-path">variables.less</span>.
        </p>
        <p>In this file you will find theme color variables as specified in below screenshot. And can change their
            values to the ones you want those to be.</p>
        <p>So, that is all you need to change the color theme. If you are willing to make any further customization
            about the theme, now you know where to change :)</p>
